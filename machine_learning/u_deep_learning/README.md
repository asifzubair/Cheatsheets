# Deep Learning #

Udacity's [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) on deep learning.

There are a number of packages available for deep learning but this [article](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/12/tensor-flow-terrific-deep-learning-library.html) gives 
some clarity on why TensorFlow could be worthwhile to learn. This is great because TF is the package of choice for the deep learning course as well !
