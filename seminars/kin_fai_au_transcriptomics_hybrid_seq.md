## Transcriptome Analysis using Hybrid Seq ##
### Kin Fai Au ###

- Hybrid Seq
  - to identify gene isoform
    - at average, 9 exons in human gene
  - tools: SLIDE, Cufflinks
  - isoform reconstruction using short RNA-seq read by ML is NP-hard
  - third generation sequencing
    - PacBio, Oxford Nanopore
    - error rate = 13%

approaches
- align short read to long reads
  - homopolymer compression
