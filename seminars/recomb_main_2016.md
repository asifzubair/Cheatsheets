## Accurate Recovery of Ribosome Positions Reveals Slow Translation of Wobble-Pairing Codons in Yeast ##
### Hao Wang ###

- ribosome profiling: takes snapshots of ribosomes during translation
    - higher pileup should show slower movements
- A-site inference
    - previously only heuristic methods used
    - Deblur produces sharper profiles

## Multitask matrix completion for learning protein interactions across diseases ##
### Meghana Kshirsagar ###

- combine information across datasets to learn ppi
- use multitask learning
- multicompletion problem for ppi
    - make some biological assumptions
