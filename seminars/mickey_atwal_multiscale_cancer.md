## Multiscale Evolution of Cancer ##gen
### Mickey Atwal ###

- different time scales of cancer
  - comparative genomics (< 10^8 ya)
  - population genetics (< 10^4 ya)
  - somatic tumor evolution in human individuals
- p53 stress response
  - whibley, nature review, 09
  - can initiate different programs
    - apoptosis
    - senescence
    - cell-cycle arrest
    - dna repair
- mdm2/mdm4, p53 stress response
- detecting gentic variants
  - functional snps in cancer pathway - hard
  - evolutionary selected snps in cancer pathway - easy
- high entropy, low entropy: detecting sweeps
  - MLPH, LCTH :  selective advantage
- why selection on p53 network ? 
  - why should early onset of cancer be under selection ? 
  - the restoration of impaired implantation in p53 null mice by LIF injection
  - in vitro fetrtilizaiton
    - woman fertility
    - enrichment of selected alleles in women with implantation success
