## Multiscale Evolution of Cancer ##
### Mickey Atwal ###

- different time scales of cancer
  - comparative genomics (< 10^8 ya)
  - population genetics (< 10^4 ya)
  - somatic tumor evolution in human individuals
  
- p53 stress response
  - whibley, nature review, 09
  - can initiate different programs
    - apoptosis
    - senescence
    - cell-cycle arrest
    - dna repair
- mdm2/mdm4, p53 stress response
- detecting gentic variants
  - functional snps in cancer pathway - hard
  - evolutionary selected snps in cancer pathway - easy
- high entropy, low entropy: detecting sweeps
  - MLPH, LCTH :  selective advantage
- why selection on p53 network ? 
  - why should early onset of cancer be under selection ? 
  - the restoration of impaired implantation in p53 null mice by LIF injection
  - in vitro fetrtilizaiton
    - woman fertility
    - enrichment of selected alleles in women with implantation success

- ectopic expression of germline genes in cancer
  - cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes
  - [piwi genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piwi-interacting_RNA) -> ectopically expressed in glioblastoma
- germness: exclusively expressed in germline and then reactivated in cancer

- somatic evolution of tumors
  - heterogeneity of tumors masked by bulk tissue analysis
- cancer as a darwinian process
  - punctuated clonal evolution = punctuated equilibrium + clonal expansion
  - navin et al, genome research 2010, nature 2011
- statistical model: probabilistic model of copy number variation
  - high temperature => low N
