## Single Cell Sequencing ##

- Bulk samples: `10^13` cells
- Shalek _et al._ Single cell transcriptomics
- Heterogeneity
    - cell2cell heterogeneity
    - heterogeneity in tissue composition
    - genetic heterogeneity in tumors
    - heterogeneity in microbial communities
```
Generation of Single-Cell Sequencing Data
    -> Raw Single-Cell sequencing Data Analysis
        -> Single-Cell Sequencing Data Analysis
            - higher variance
            - identity of samples
```
