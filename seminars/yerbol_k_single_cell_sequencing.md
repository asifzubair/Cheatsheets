## Single Cell Sequencing ##

- Bulk samples: `10^13` cells
- Shalek _et al._ Single cell transcriptomics
- Heterogeneity
    - cell2cell heterogeneity
    - heterogeneity in tissue composition
    - genetic heterogeneity in tumors
    - heterogeneity in microbial communities
```
Generation of Single-Cell Sequencing Data
    -> Raw Single-Cell sequencing Data Analysis
        -> Single-Cell Sequencing Data Analysis
            - higher variance
            - identity of samples
```
- Fluidigm C1 System
- [SEURAT](http://www.satijalab.org/seurat.html): analysis and visualization of single-cell RNa-seq data
- [TPM](http://www.rna-seqblog.com/rpkm-fpkm-and-tpm-clearly-explained)
- [tSNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne) + DBSCAN
QC:
- fluidigm system: visual inspection to check single cell sample
- regular ngs QC
    - library complexity
