## Formation and interpretation of the Dorsal/NF-kB gradient ##
### Gregory T. Reeves ###

- Medicine and Tissue Engineering
- general pattern for cell differentiation
    - morphogen gradient
    - \Del^2c + f(c,\lambda)
- same signals pattern tissues aare also required for healthy adult tissue
    - immune response
    - inflammatory response
    - stem cell maintenance

- dorsal gradient dictates early DV patterning

- gradient too narrow for type III genes
    - Liberman LM, Reeves GT et al., 2009, PNAS
- measuring the gradient over time
    - fluctuating level of dorsal
        - it builds up and goes away, probably mirroring nuclear cycle
- fluorescence (deconvolution)
    - O'Connel, Reeves, 2015, Plos Comp Bio
    - solves type iii gene expression problem
    - dynamic range
- how is the dorsal gradient formed, globally ?
