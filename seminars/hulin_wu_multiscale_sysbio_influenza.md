multi-level system:
- organ level modelling
- cellular level modelling
- protein and gene level modelling

challenges:
- multi-level and multiscale mathematical models
- lack of enough data to identify model parameters and model structures
- lack of __statistical methods__ for complex ODE model inference
- large system analysis: eg. contrallability and stability
- validations
- applications

ODE models
challenges: 
- how to determine the significant edges of the network ?
- how to deal with the curse of dimensionality ? 

High Dimensional ODE Model Building
- nonlinear regulation ODEs
- non parametric regulation ODEs: sparse additive ODEs
- multiple-gene co regulation ODEs
- gene-protein interaction network

Mechanistic Models: models are derived from biological principles and mechanisms
- cellular level
- immune response to influenza infection

_statistical methods_ to link gene, protein, molecule, and cell-level models to phenotypic outcomes and symptoms
