## inferring evolutionary history from spatial data ##
### Erik L ###

- how can we use the pattern of genetic relatedness to determine the rates of gene flow in the region ? 
- average coalescence time - can be aprroximated by the pairwise genetic distance between genomes
- MCMC
  - exponential priors
