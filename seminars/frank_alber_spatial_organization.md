## Mapping the Spatial Organization of Genomes and Cells ##
### Frank Alber ###

- computational structural biology
- bridging atomic with cellular scales
  - look at variety of methods and integrate those
- eukaryotic genome structures are nt randomly organized in the nucleus
  - chr19 located inside and is more open
  - chr18 same ssize but contracted
  - ana pombo, cell, 2013 
  - berger et al, nat methods, 2008
- topological associated domains (TAD) /contact domain organization
- structural hierarchy of chromatin organization
  - Data Sources
    - Hi-C, 5-C, 3-C: chromosome capture methods
    - Lamina-DamID method
    - 3D Fish imaging
  - optimization
  - population analysis
- Hi-C: kalhour, alber, chen, nat biotech 2012
- structural representation
  - topological domains
    - Shin et al., 2015, NAR 
- tjong PNAS 2016
