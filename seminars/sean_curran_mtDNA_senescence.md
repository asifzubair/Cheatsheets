## Sean Curran ##

- sperm motility
- sperm count
- sperm morphology

- alh-6 regulates aging in a diet-dependent manner
- alh-6 hermaphrodites have significantly reduced total brood size compared to WT
- prdh-1 mutation rescues the reproductive defect of alh-6
- c. elegans wt male sperm outcompetes hermaphrodite sperm by size

- aldh4a1 expression is downregulated in mice testis with age
