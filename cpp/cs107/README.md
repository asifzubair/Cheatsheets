Stanford's [programming paradigms](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS107) class by [Jerry Cain](https://twitter.com/jerrycainjr)

Advanced memory management features of C and C++; the differences between imperative and object-oriented paradigms. The functional paradigm (using LISP) and concurrent programming (using C and C++). Brief survey of other modern languages such as Python, Objective C, and C#.

Might be helpful to read [this](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~sjac/c-to-cpp-info/references) note with regard to references in C and CPP.
